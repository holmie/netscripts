==========

Network related scripts and things

	- wiremaps.py - Script to fetch all linkdata from the wiremaps API (https://github.com/vincentbernat/wiremaps) and generate a dotfile to be used with graphviz to generate a network map
	- nfdump_networkx_gexf.py - Script to read nfdump output and create a gexf file to represent the hosts talking to eachother, tried visualizing this, image is too huge, might be OK for smaller amounts of data :-)
